        <h2>Why This Project Exists</h2>
        <p>
            Cook & Look was created by a team of one enthusiastic coder during the <strong>CodeCraze Hackathon</strong>!
            Our mission is simple: make cooking fun, accessible, and social for everyone.
        </p>
        <p>
            From discovering new recipes to saving your favorites and sharing culinary creations,
            we wanted to combine creativity, technology, and delicious food into one seamless platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            We hope you enjoy exploring, saving, and sharing your recipes as much as we enjoyed building this app!
